Coding best practices are required for coding on cloud platform or any other Platform/Frameork/Language. For cloud platform it become very important as this is shared resource. For the purpose of writing best code we suggest and follow following two practices one for coding patterns and best practices, second for coding style

Coding Best Practices: Salesforce suggests coding best practices to help us write good code from performance point of view. There are  platform specific recommendations to follow in order to make sure that the developers are following governing rules/practices/limits. Being a cloud platform there are governing limits to avoid potential performance failures on shared resource due developer error causing performance issues by putting extra load on processing. For coding best practices below is the link to slaesforce best practices that provide the guidelines and examples.

Coding Style: For coding style we recommend to follow Java guidlines. Link below is suggested approach to coding styles

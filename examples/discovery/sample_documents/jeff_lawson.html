<p>
  Jeff Lawson is the founder, CEO and chairman of Twilio. A serial entrepreneur and a software developer, Jeff co-founded Twilio
  in 2008 to bring communications into the world of software. Twilio’s cloud communication platform enables software developers
  around the world to build world class customer engagement into their applications. As of 2017, Twilio hosts more than 40,000
  customers and over 1.6 million developer accounts on the platform. Under Jeff’s leadership, the company has been named
  to the CNBC Top 50 Disruptor list for 4 consecutive years, the Deloitte Fast 500 for 3 years and has been ranked by GlassDoor
  as one of the 25 highest rated public cloud companies to work for. Jeff is also listed in Fortune Magazine’s 2016 annual
  ranking of the most 40 most influential young people in business. Twilio made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange
  in June 2016, ending a drought of technology IPOs. Jeff believes the best companies successfully weave social impact into
  their culture, which led to the creation of Twilio.org, with a mission to fuel communications that give hope, power, and
  freedom. With Jeff’s leadership, Twilio took the 1% Pledge, which committed 1% of the company’s pre-IPO equity to sustainably
  fund Twilio.org. Prior to starting Twilio, Jeff was co-founder & CTO of NineStar (an action sporting goods retailer), founding
  CTO of Stubhub.com (the leading online ticket exchange) and co-founder, CEO & CTO of Versity (an academic community for
  college students). He was also one of the first product managers for Amazon Web Services. Jeff grew up in the suburbs of
  Detroit, started his first company at age 12 doing event video production, and DJ’d his way through college, and earned
  his BS in Computer Science & Film/Video from University of Michigan. He is a father of two young boys, enjoys photography,
  and always makes time to hack on new software and hardware projects.
